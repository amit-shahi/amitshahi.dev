# Project Overview

This is an awesome Todo App v1.0 created to share the fun and exciting feature of Angular & .NET Core together to build Single Page Application. The  project was created using following stack:

## Frontend Technologies

1. Angular 6.0.8
2. Bootstrap 4.1.3
3. TypeScript 2.7.2
4. HTML 5 &amp; CSS 3

## Backend Technologies

1. ASP.NET Core 2.2
2. EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory 2.2.6
3. AutoMapper 8.1.1
4. AutoMapper Dependency Injection Extension 3.0.1

## Software Requirement

1. Please download ASP.NET Core 2.2 on your machine from [.NET Core 2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)
2. Make sure to install Node Js v10.16.3 or later, so Angular project can be compiled and run.
3. Using Git Bash or Git Client (Git Desktop), clone this project on to your system by issuing `git clone https://github.com/amit-shahi/Sample-Projects--.NET-Core-2/TodoListApp`
4. Once the clone is completed, Open the Visual Studio Code and make sure you are in the project root directory, Run `dotnet restore`

5. Once All the .NET & NPM Package references are downloaded, Run `dotnet build` &amp; `dotnet run` command to build and run the Client and Selfhosted API endpoint.


# ToDo_List_App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0.

## Development server (optional) (p.s: This command runs behind the scene when you run 'dotnet run')

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. 
You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests (TODO)

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests (TODO)

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
